        A hamburger, also called a burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
        beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The patties are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish or a "special sauce",
        often a variation of Thousand Island dressing and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty
        topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.

        Hamburgers are typically associated with fast-food restaurants and diners, but are also sold at various other
        restaurants. There are numerous international and regional variations of hamburger. Some of the largest
        multinational fast-food chains have a burger as one of their core products: McDonald's Big Mac and Burger King's
        Whopper have become global icons of American culture.
