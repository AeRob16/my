            alt="">Pizza is a traditional Italian dish typically
            consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients,
            baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

            The term pizza was first recorded in the year 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town
            of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania.Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating modern
            pizza in Naples.In 2009, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a
            traditional speciality guaranteed dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's
            list of intangible cultural heritage.

            Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of
            restaurants, including pizzerias, Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and
            as street food.In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use
            of a knife and fork.In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while
            held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits
            for self-assembly. They are then cooked using a home oven.

            In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000
            pizzerias.Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given
            day.
