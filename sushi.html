        Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice , usually with some sugar and salt, plus a variety of
        ingredients, such as vegetables,
        and any meat, but most commonly seafood. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary
        widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari , or sumeshi.

        The creator of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most
        known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period. It was
        the fast food of the ch≈çnin class in the Edo period.

        Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
        short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
        imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi,
        and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon are popular garnishes for the dish.

        Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a dish that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat,
        without sushi rice.
